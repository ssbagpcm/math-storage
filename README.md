# High data storage, powered by maths.

***The theoric part is very easy, but the reality is different.***

## Here is the list of actions to do to create a data compression.

**STEP 1**

- Choose a file or folder.
- If the choice of the user is a file, go to STEP 2.
- If the choice of the user is a folder, transorm it to a .zip file using a little python function and go to STEP 2 after that.

---

**STEP 2**

- When the user has selected, the file or transformed the folder, take all the binary of the file.
- Save the binary to a .bin file and go to STEP 3.

---

**STEP 3**

- Create a python function to read the .bin file created and generate fastly by converting the binary to deciaml, a number with base 10.
- Save the generated large number to a .txt file and in the same time, remove all the precedent file from the computer, beacause if the file is big, they will take some place inside the computer. After this, go to STEP 4.
